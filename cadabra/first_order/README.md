# first order area metric gravity

* [split.py](split.py) defines methods for the construction of the 3+1 theory from the ans√§tze and solutions derived in [../../haskell/ansaetze](../../haskell/ansaetze)
* `mass_AB.cdb, kin_ABI.cdb, kin_ApBq.cdb` contain the respective constituents of the Lagrangian.
* The directory [eom](./eom/) contains the field equations, split into scalar, vector, and tt parts with methods from [split.py](split.py).
