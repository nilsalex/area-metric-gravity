# linear-area-lagrangian

Perturbative expansion of area metric gravity to second order in the equations of motion (third order in the lagrangian). This repository contains:

 * [Haskell application](haskell/ansaetze) generating Lorentz invariant expansion coefficients and solving the diffeomorphism covariance equations perturbatively
 * [Cadabra code](cadabra) using the results from the Haskell application and performing a 3+1 split of the equations of motions
 * [Maple and Mathematica code](linalg) for further inspection of the equations of motion
